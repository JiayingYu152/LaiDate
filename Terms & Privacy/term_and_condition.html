      <h4>MEMBERS</h4>

        When a user registers within the Services, they become a member
        (hereinafter - the “Member”). We do not influence the relationships
        between Members. Members may have only one account (hereinafter -
        “Membership”) with the Services. Multiple accounts will be blocked. Upon

        making a photo as defined by us and which will later be verified by our
        team to meet our guidelines and providing information on your marital
        status, age, gender and children. We accept selfies (photos) as a way of
        verification. The ‘verified’mark is removed once a selfie is deleted
        upon the Member's request and/or we have a reason to believe that the
        Member has provided us with misleading information. During the
        verification we do not confirm nationality, location, profession and

        Marriage Broker Law (IMBRA).

      <h4>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>

      </p>

      <h4>SUPPLIERS</h4>
      <p>
        When we run the Services, we may be serviced by various third parties
        and affiliate marketing partners (collectively, “Suppliers”). The
        Suppliers are independent contractors and are not agents, or employees
        of the Company. We are not responsible for the willful or negligent acts
        and/or omissions of any Supplier or any of its respective employees,
        agents, servants or representatives including, without limitation, their
        failure to deliver Services, or partial or inadequate delivery of
        Services. According to terms of agreement with our Suppliers, we are
        prohibited from rendering the Suppliers’ contact information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppliers provide full, accurate and legitimate information required for
        the registration of Members within the Services prior to their
        registration according to the terms of Agreement. Each supplier may
        provide translation services for the registered Members and have access
        to all the correspondence of such Members. Suppliers provide additional
        services in accordance to the terms of their agreement with us. Any
        additional services requested by our Members, which fall into the
        Suppliers scope of activity, but not defined by our terms of Agreement
        with Supplier, may be processed by Suppliers, but are not automatically
        granted.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are not in any way responsible for the quality of any additional
        services provided by the Suppliers.

      <li>DISPUTES</li>
      <h4>IF YOU ARE A US RESIDENT</h4>
      <p>
        READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO SUBMIT
        THEIR DISPUTES TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU
        CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE COMPANY. You thus give up your right to go to
        court to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for
        matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be
        determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. You are
        entitled to a fair hearing but the arbitration procedures are simpler
        and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions
        are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited
        review by a court. This arbitration agreement further includes an
        agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity
        (and not as a class action or other representative proceedings).
      </p>

      <p>
        Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Services
        sold or distributed by or through the Company shall be resolved in the
        following manner.
      </p>
      <ol type="a" class="other-ol">
        <li>
          <strong>Informal Process First</strong>. You agree to first contact
          our customer support by email and attempt toresolve the dispute with
          us informally for a period of 60 days. Please refer to
          <a href="#term-and-condition-contact-us">CONTACT US</a>
          sections for details.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>. If the dispute has not been
          resolved in 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or
          controversy arising out of or in connection with or relating to the
          Services and/or this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach
          thereof, including disputes related to the applicability,
          enforceability, interpretation or formation of this Agreement to
          arbitrate, by binding arbitration.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Arbitration Tribunal</strong>. The American Arbitration
          Association (“AAA”) will administer the arbitration. In the event the
          AAA declines to administer the arbitration, the arbitrator(s) will be
          appointed by the New York Supreme Court located in New York County,
          New York pursuant to New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (“CPLR”) §
          7504. The parties irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the
          courts of the State of New York for the purpose of administering an
          arbitration under Article 75 of the CPLR. Nothing in this Section
          shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable
          relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or
          threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that
          party's data security, intellectual property rights, or other
          proprietary rights, or to seek other relief in connection with the
          arbitration.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Arbitrator and Rules</strong>. If the arbitration involves
          claims totaling less than US $250,000, the arbitration will be
          conducted before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be
          final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by
          the United States Federal Arbitration Act and the AAA Consumer
          Arbitration Rules and AAA Consumer Due Process Protocol. If the
          arbitration involves claims totaling more than US $250,000, the
          arbitration will be conducted before three neutral arbitrators, whose
          decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will
          be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act and the AAA
          Commercial Arbitration Rules and AAA Consumer Due Process Protocol.
          The AAA rules may be found online at www.adr.org.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Location of Arbitration</strong>. The arbitration will be
          conducted in New York City, New York, USA, or such other place as
          chosen by the Arbitration Tribunal. If you live in the United States,
          you have the right to ask the Arbitration Tribunal to conduct the
          arbitration near your home if the arbitration involves an in-person
          hearing.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Costs and Fees</strong>. Payment of all filing, administration
          and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by AAA rules, but if
          you are financially unable to pay any of them, the Company will pay
          them for You.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Starting an Arbitration</strong>. A party who intends to seek
          arbitration must file a claim with the American Arbitration
          Association and pay the required fee. The instructions for filing a
          claim may be found online at www.adr.org.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Your Right to Sue in Small Claims Court</strong>. Provided you
          live in the United States, you may sue for US $5,000 or less in a
          small claims court of competent jurisdiction as an alternative to
          engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your
          commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process, and
          engaging in the informal dispute resolution process is a condition
          precedent of your right to sue or arbitrate against us.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER</strong>. YOU AND THE
          COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES'
          INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
          PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
          ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO
          CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY
          NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY
          ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE
          RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION,
          COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER
          REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>IF YOU ARE A NON-US RESIDENT</h4>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that the transactions involving your use of the Services
        and any purchases therein took place in the country of incorporation of
        the Company. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the
        Services sold or distributed by or through the Company will be resolved
        by binding arbitration under the LCIA Rules, rather than in court.
      </p>

      <p>
        The number of arbitrators shall be three. The arbitration shall take
        place in London, UK. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings
        shall be English. The governing law of this Agreement shall be the
        substantive law of the country of incorporation of the Company. There is
        no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
        award is limited. Arbitrators, however, can award you the same damages
        and relief, and must honor the same terms in this Agreement, as a court
        would. The LCIA's Rules are available here. Payment of all filing,
        administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the LCIA's rules.
        We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted
        only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or
        representative action.
      </p>

      <p>
        THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE
        INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
        PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR
        REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR
        PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS
        AGREEMENT.
      </p>

      <p>
        If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration
        we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or
        we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of
        intellectual property rights. You will attempt to resolve all disputes
        with respect to the Services through communication with our customer
        service. If parties are unable to resolve the dispute, You must use the
        dispute resolution mechanism discussed above in this section. Please
        also note should you chargeback any transactions billed to your account,
        the Company may be required to disclose any and/or all private
        communications sent/received by you through our Services in order to
        prove the validity of the charges billed to your account and our Privacy
        Policy will therefore not restrain any such disclosures.
      </p>
