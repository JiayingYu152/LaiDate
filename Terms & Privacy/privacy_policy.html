      <h4>PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT USING COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
      <p>
        We use cookie technology on the Website as part of the statistical
        reporting. It contains personal data used by the Website to personalize
        your experience (e.g. rotating profiles on the Dating.com home page) and
        to gather statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is
        downloaded during your experience, the domain name and country of the
        internet provider that you have come from (e.g.‘aol’, or ‘umich.edu’),
        and addresses of those websites you have visited just before and after
        the Website. Nevertheless, we do not associate any of this personal data
        with you as an individual. Only an aggregate measure is taken. Cookie
        personal data allows us to follow your “clickstream” activity (i.e., how
        visitors navigate our Website as they move from page to page). It is
        important to note that cookies never capture your individual email
        address or any of your private personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also operate standard web server log files to assist in counting
        visitor numbers and analyzing our Service technical capability. This
        personal data is used to establish how many people use our Services,
        enable us to organize our Services for the best usability, make our
        Services suitable for your browser, and ensure that our Services are
        working at their full potential. Although we collect personal data on
        online traffic, we do not record personal data on particular visitors of
        our Services, which means that no personal data about you as an
        individual is retained or used. You are able to browse the Website
        without cookies by configuring your browser to reject all cookies, or to
        alert you when a cookie is sent. Since each browser is different, you
        should refer to the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change
        your cookie preferences.

        us through the respective Social Media you used for registering an
        account with us, privacy settings on the applicable social media site

        in, videos, contacts list, friends lists or followers and other

        managed by a Social Media Site with your account on our Services and
        authorizing us to have access to your personal data, you agree that we
        can collect, store, use and retain the personal data provided by these

        also work with third parties to employ technologies, including the
        application of statistical modeling tools, which attempt to recognize
        you across multiple devices so that we understand how you use our
        Services across various devices, to ensure the safety and security of
        your data and the Services, to show you targeted advertising (with your
        consent) tailored to your interests and experience, and to measure the

      <h4>AGGREGATED DATA</h4>
      <p>
        We may create aggregated data for internal use or for improving Services
        and creating new features. Aggregated data is anonymous and is not
        linked to any personal data. Aggregated information helps understand
        trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be
        considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to
        customer desires. We may share such aggregated data with our partners,
        without restriction, on commercial terms that we can determine in our
        sole discretion.
      </p>

      <h4>AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING</h4>
      <p>
        Automated Decision-Making (“ADM”) is when a decision is made solely on
        automated processing (including profiling) which produces legal effects
        or significantly affects an individual. Generally, ADM is prohibited
        when a decision has a legal or similar significant effect on an
        individual unless (a) you provide us with your consent, (b) ADM is
        authorized by law or (c) ADM is necessary for the performance of or
        entering into a contract.
      </p>
      <p>We use ADM for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recommending other members and communication topics to you.</li>
        <li>
          Blocking or limiting features for the users when we detect prohibited
          content or violations of our
          <a href="./term_and_condition.html">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chargeback fraud alert and prevention, based on the information about
          conflicting location and engagement in fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of our support functions, like requests to change your profile
          information, update your payment method, actualise Membership details,
          etc., may be processed by our AI-based chatbot. The chatbot will
          always request for your consent for a particular action, and its
          activities will be logged in our files.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you believe that ADM acted inappropriately or want to be serviced by
        a human, please <a href="#private-policy-contact-us">CONTACT US</a>.

      <h4>MARKETING</h4>
      <p>
        We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data
        uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. Where you have
        interacted with us, we will send you marketing communications from time
        to time. Such marketing communications are usually sent by email or text
        (SMS). If you do not want to receive marketing communications, please
        refer to HOW TO OPT-OUT FROM SMS MESSAGES or HOW TO OPT-OUT FROM E-MAIL
        MESSAGES down below. You may also select the “unsubscribe” link in the

      <p>
        When you receive communications from Us, including marketing
        communications, we may share your personal data with third party
        companies who help us conduct marketing activities. For example, we may
        use a third party to help us send email messages to you and help us
        understand how you have interacted with that email.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on how you are using our Services, your needs and preferences,
        with the purpose to provide you with optimal matching possibilities, we
        may offer you registration with our Linked Services, operated by the
        Data Controller or its affiliated companies (“Linked Services”). You may
        receive marketing information from these Linked Services depending on
        your profile settings and our matching algorithm. To stop receiving
        correspondence from the Linked Services you can click the unsubscribe
        link found at the bottom of each email you receive, by reaching out to
        our support team via

        sms, push notifications, Whatsapp, Facebook, Wechat, QQ and any other
        messengers) for customer support and/or marketing purposes if you have
        provided us with such. You may at any time withdraw your consent on such
        communication by contacting our support team via

        described in this <a href="#privacy-policy-top">Privacy Policy</a>. We
        utilize standard contractual clauses approved by the European
        Commission, adopt other means under European Union law (such as, where

        legitimize data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other
        countries.
      </p>

      <li>HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA</li>
      <p>
        We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill

        purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
        consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
        potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
        personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
        whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
        applicable legal requirements.

      <p>
        In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it
        can no longer be associated with you) for research, statistical or other
        purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without
        further notice to you.
